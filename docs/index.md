## Quick Comparison :eyes:

::: tip Note
- OD = Outside Diameter (mm).
- wt = Unit weight (kg/m). The below value are based on material Carbon Steel with SCH40 for ASME pipe and SGP for JIS pipe.

## Carbon Pipe - ASME Standard ðŸ“—
In accordance with ASTM B36.10M Welded and Seamless Wrought Steel Pipe

::: tip Note
- OD = Outside Diameter (mm).
- Plain text = Thickness (mm), _Italic text_ = Unit weight (kg/m).
- Unit weight are calculated based on CS material (density = 7850 kg/m<sup>3</sup>).
