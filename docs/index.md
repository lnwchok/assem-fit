## Quick Comparison :eyes:

::: tip Note
- OD = Outside Diameter (mm).
- wt = Unit weight (kg/m). The below value are based on material Carbon Steel with SCH40 for ASME pipe and SGP for JIS pipe.

## ðŸ“— ASME CS Pipe
In accordance with ASTM B36.10M Welded and Seamless Wrought Steel Pipe

::: tip Note
- `OD` = Outside Diameter (mm).
- Plain text = Thickness (mm), _Italic text_ = Unit weight (kg/m).
- Unit mass of pipe shall be calculated from following formula assuming `1`cm<sup>3</sup> of steel to be `7.85g` so that `W = 0.02466*t(D-t)`, where 
  - `W` : unit mass of pipe (kg/m)
  - `t` : wall thickness of pipe (mm)
  - `D` : outside diameter of pipe (mm)

## ðŸ“— ASME SS Pipe
In accordance with ASTM B36.19M Stainless Steel Pipe

::: tip Note
- `OD` = Outside Diameter (mm).
- Plain text = Thickness (mm), _Italic text_ = Unit weight (kg/m).
- Unit weight are calculated based on SS304 material (density = 8000 kg/m<sup>3</sup>).

## ðŸ“™ JIS CS Pipe
In accordance with JIS G 3454 Carbon steel pipes for Pressure Service

::: tip Note
- Plain text = Thickness (mm), _Italic text_ = Unit weight (kg/m).
- Unit mass of pipe shall be calculated from following formula assuming `1`cm<sup>3</sup> of steel to be `7.85g` so that `W = 0.02466*t(D-t)`, where 
  - `W` : unit mass of pipe (kg/m)
  - `t` : wall thickness of pipe (mm)
  - `D` : outside diameter of pipe (mm)

## ðŸ“™ JIS SS Pipe
In accordance with JIS G 3459 Stainless steel pipes

::: tip Note
- OD = Outside Diameter (mm).
- Plain text = Thickness (mm), _Italic text_ = Unit weight (kg/m).
- Unit mass of pipe shall be calculated from following formula assuming `1`cm<sup>3</sup> of steel to be `7.93g` so that `W = 0.02491*t(D-t)`, where 
  - `W` : unit mass of pipe (kg/m)
  - `t` : wall thickness of pipe (mm)
  - `D` : outside diameter of pipe (mm)
